# Chore Up
## About
Chore Up is a full stack web application equipped with complete CRUD functionality. 
The goal was to make an intuitive, stream-lined, good-looking, (additional adjective) team driven chore tracking application. 
Visually, I tried to mimic the ergonomic aesthetics of virtual kanban boards such as Trello/Notion.
This was one of my first big solo projects, also written in PHP which was interesting to use to say the least.

Thanks for checking it out!

❤️ Ryan
